## 1.Image Processing

Canny edge detection algorithm steps:

1. Gaussian filter(denoise).
2. Calculate intensity and directions of image gradient.
3. Non-max suppression of the gradient according to gradient direction.
4. Double threshold detection get weak edges and strong edges.
5. Tracking edges by hysteresis.
